Powershell helpers for sunshine server admin.

Tested on Windows 10 only, must have Sunshine installed with the service "sunshinesvc" present in your services (start > run > services.msc). Should be there
once you've installed Sunshine.

To use, just clone this repo/download and unzip and place on your desktop or wherever you keep your files.

Ensure the service startup type is set to "Manual". I don't like the idea of anyone being able to tap into my PC and view my screen on a client running moonlight inside the LAN so created this to easily switch it off and on.

Find it works best by using an RDP/VNC session to the host PC to switch it off and on remotely (when you're in another room in the house for example).
